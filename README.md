# Multiple event identification and characterization by retrospective analysis of structured data streams

## AKA Post-processing some sensor data to see what happened

### Section 1

Assumptions:

System suitable for analysis have the following characteristics:
1. The system generates one or more "events" that occur during operation
2. The "event" occurs sporadically, and has some tail
3. The "event" is associated with a "small and limited" number of sensing signals. That is, a limited number of sensor are able to capture the event

Goals:
1. Characterize the event signatures in the signals AKA, develop a feature set for the signals 

Editors note: This is an area I feel comfortable embarking on a literature review, am deeply interested in the below as well

2. Identify events within the signals and estimate the strength or weight (or whatever metric makes sense) of the event

Mechanism for achieving stated Goals: 
Multiple Event Identification and Characterization (MEIC) Algorithm, which is an optimization algorithm. 

Case Study:
Methods applied to some industrial process that has to do with rolled steel.
